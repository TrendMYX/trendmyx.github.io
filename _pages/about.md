Welcome to my personal website.

### Fun Fact:


A lot of people who don’t speak Chinese find it tricky to pronounce my first name, **Yuxuan**, because the sounds for “U” and “X” in Chinese are perhaps different from other languages. A close English approximation would be something like **“Yoo-Shyooan”** — with “Yoo” said in a falling tone and “Shyooan” in a rising one.

That said, to keep things simple, feel free to just call me **Johan** which is my English name. Or, if you’re curious, you can check out this [Chinese name website](https://www.namechef.co/chinese-name/details/%E7%85%9C%E8%BB%92/) and learn a few fun facts(pronunciation) about it!
